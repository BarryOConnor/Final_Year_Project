# Final_Year_Project

My Final Year Project focused on creating a feature rich but affordable weather station which could record various weather information and then save that information to an online database. The project is based upon an Arduino Uno and follows the journey from concept to a working prototype through the use of Evolutionary Prototyping methodologies for hardware, AGILE methodologies for the project and test Driven Development for the software.
