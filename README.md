# Final_Year_Project

The project attempts to investigate the need and market for an affordable weather station that has comparable sensor readings and features to those commercially available, with the emphasis on making a device that would be suitable and within the budget of small farmers whose livelihoods depend on their crop. The project also attempts to form a conclusion on whether mass-produced consumer electronics and microcontrollers are capable of this task.

The work explores the background of weather conditions and their effect on crops and uses this as a basis for selecting the array of sensors that make up the prototype.
In terms of the market, research and costings are carried out to discover where the gap in the market is and this price gap is used as a basis to select a budget for the project of Â£60 where all materials for the prototype weather station should be under this price.

The project was approached with an Agile project management style and a Test-Driven Development approach to testing. This was backed up by the use of a hardware-based methodology called Evolutionary Prototyping. The use of these combined resulted in an incremental process that was tested at each iteration and allowed for exploration of the unknown subject of electronics in a measured and reliable way.

The project aimed to allow the communication of local weather data through the use of sensors and a custom-designed Arduino implementation. When collected, the data would be sent via a SIM800L 2G GSM module to a server for storage and retrieval.

The final prototype did suffer from some issues with an intermittently faulty GSM modem module but testing did succeed in demonstrating that the results were recorded on the server and that the weather station prototype did in fact function as intended. Overall the project was successful but time spent on hardware issues resulted in a loss of the web frontend intended for the project.
